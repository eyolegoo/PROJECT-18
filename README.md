<img width="399" alt="Infrastructure design" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/d8fb8459-59c7-4cb2-bf9f-3d219341a0ae">


- **This Project is a continuation of Project 16**
  
- Before we go deeper into automating other parts of our infrastructure on AWS, it is very important to fully understand certain concepts around **Networking** (in case this is completely new area to you). Networking is a very broad topic and some of internals of Terraform modules related to Networking, like ***cidrsubnet()***, may still not be fully clear to you.

- To fully clear your understanding, we highly recommend you watching Networking videos by Eli the Computer Guy on YouTube, and in addition to that, read following golden articles on **Networking Terminology, Interfaces, Protocols, IP Address, Subnets, and CIDR Notation by Justin Ellingwood from Digital Ocean**.

  - [Networking Part 1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-ip-addresses-subnets-and-cidr-notation-for-networking#netmasks-and-subnets)

**IP Address**

  - An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

**Subnets**

  - A subnet, or subnetwork, is a segmented piece of a larger network. More specifically, subnets are a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments.
    
**CIDR Notation**

  - CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is an alternate method of representing a subnet mask. It is simply a count of the number of network bits (bits that are set to 1) in the subnet mask.

**IP Routing**

  - IP routing is the process of sending packets from a host on one network to another host on a different remote network

**Internet Gateways**

  - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet

**NAT**

  - A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.

**Networking**

***Private subnets & best practices***


- Create 4 private subnets keeping in mind following principles:

    - Make sure you use variables or ***length()*** function to determine the number of AZs
      
    - Use variables and ***cidrsubnet()*** function to allocate ***vpc_cidr*** for subnets

    - Keep variables and resources in separate files for better code structure and readability

    - Tags all the resources you have created so far. Explore how to use ***format()*** and ***count*** functions to automatically tag subnets with its respective number.

**Internet Gateways & ***format()*** function**

- Create an Internet Gateway in a separate Terraform file ***internet_gateway.tf***

<img width="958" alt="Internet-gw" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/f613f030-ae92-4943-9720-760ef77b7b5c">



**NAT Gateways**

- Create 1 NAT Gateways and 1 Elastic IP (EIP) addresses

- Now use similar approach to create the NAT Gateways in a new file called ***natgateway.tf**.

- Note: We need to create an Elastic IP for the NAT Gateway, and you can see the use of ***depends_on*** to indicate that the Internet Gateway resource must be available before this should be created. Although Terraform does a good job to manage dependencies, but in some cases, it is good to be explicit.

- You can read more on dependencies [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on)


**AWS ROUTES**

- Create a file called **route_tables.tf** and use it to create routes for both public and private subnets, create the below resources.

- Ensure they are properly tagged.

  - aws_route_table
    
  - aws_route
    
  - aws_route_table_association
 
<img width="955" alt="route-table" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/233cd17a-b115-42f0-8ecd-fe44059d9567">


- Now, we are done with Networking part of AWS set up, let us move on to Compute and Access Control configuration automation using Terraform!


**AWS Identity and Access Management**

- [IaM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/) and [Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)

  
- We want to pass an IAM role our EC2 instances to give them access to some specific resources, so we need to do the following:

1. - Create [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html)

- Assume Role uses Security Token Service (STS) API that returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use ***AssumeRole*** within your account or for cross-account access.

- Add the following code to a new file named ***roles.tf***

2. - Create [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html) for this role
  
- This is where we need to define a required policy (i.e., permissions) according to our requirements. For example, allowing an IAM role to perform action **describe** applied to EC2 instances:

3. - Attach the ***Policy*** to the ***IAM Role***
  
- This is where, we will be attaching the policy which we created above, to the role we created in the first step.

4. - Create an [Instance Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html) and interpolate the ***IAM Role***

<img width="960" alt="roles" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/74ac21b5-7835-487a-ad0f-c60e3f8677bb">

  
- We are pretty much done with Identity and Management part for now, let us move on and create other resources required.


**Resources to be created**

- As per our architecture we need to do the following:

 1. - Create Security Groups
  
 2. - Create Target Group for Nginx, WordPress and Tooling
      
 3. - Create certificate from AWS certificate manager

 4. - Create an External Application Load Balancer and Internal Application Load Balancer.

 5. - create launch template for Bastion, Tooling, Nginx and WordPress

 6. - Create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for Bastion, Tooling, Nginx and WordPress

 7. - Create Elastic Filesystem

 8. - Create Relational Database (RDS)


**CREATE SECURITY GROUPS**

- We are going to create all the security groups in a single file, then we are going to refrence this security group within each resources that needs it.

***IMPORTANT***:

  - Check out the terraform documentation for [security group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group)

  - Check out the terraform documentation for [security group rule](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group_rule)

- Create a file and name it ***security.tf***, copy and paste the code below

<img width="960" alt="Sec grp 1" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/900dde5e-eec4-4445-af4d-f72f19f85b95">

<img width="960" alt="Sec grp 2" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/645dd1c5-41b3-4840-8f24-20d0597d6600">

<img width="738" alt="Sec grp 3" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/88f2b399-4c75-453a-8ffd-e1f5229772ab">


- ***IMPORTANT NOTE***: We used the ***aws_security_group_rule*** to refrence another security group in a security group.


**CREATE CERTIFICATE FROM AMAZON CERIFICATE MANAGER**

- Create ***cert.tf*** file and add the following code snippets to it.

- ***NOTE***: Read Through to change the domain name to your own domain name and every other name that needs to be changed.

  - Check out the terraform documentation for [AWS Certifivate manager](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/acm_certificate)
 
**Create an external (Internet facing) [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancer-getting-started.html)**

- Create a file ***called alb.tf***

- First of all we will create the ALB, then we create the target group and lastly we will create the lsitener rule.

- Useful Terraform Documentation, go through this documentation and understand the arguement needed for each resources:

  - [ALB](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb)
    
  - [ALB-target](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb_target_group)
    
  - [ALB-listener](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb_listener)
    
- We need to create an ALB to balance the traffic between the Instances:

- To inform our ALB to where route the traffic we need to create a [Target Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html) to point to its targets:

- Then we will need to create a [Listner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html) for this target Group

**Create an Internal (Internal) [Application Load Balancer (ALB)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-internal-load-balancers.html)**
  
- For the Internal Load balancer we will fillow the same concepts with the external load balancer.

- Add the code snippets inside the ***alb.tf*** file

**To inform our ALB to where route the traffic we need to create a [Target Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html) to point to its targets**:

**Then we will need to create a [Listner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html) for this target Group**

<img width="960" alt="Creating Alb" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/bdb4795c-4b2e-4b7a-bd39-912cf9325bfc">

**Add the following outputs to ***output.tf*** to print them on screen**

<img width="747" alt="output" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/b206b416-414f-4121-b538-9b491667f1a0">


**CREATING AUSTOALING GROUPS**

- This Section we will create the [Auto Scaling Group (ASG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-groups.html)
  
- Now we need to configure our ASG to be able to scale the EC2s out and in depending on the application traffic.

- Before we start configuring an ASG, we need to create the launch template and the the AMI needed. For now we are going to use a random AMI from AWS, then in project 19, we will use [Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/intro) to create our ami.

- Based on our Architetcture we need for Auto Scaling Groups for bastion, nginx, wordpress and tooling, so we will create two files; ***asg-bastion-nginx.tf*** will contain Launch Template and Austoscaling froup for Bastion and Nginx, then ***asg-wordpress-tooling.tf*** will contain Launch Template and Austoscaling group for wordpress and tooling.

- Useful Terraform Documentation, go through this documentation and understand the arguement needed for each resources:

   - [SNS-topic](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/sns_topic)
    
   - [SNS-notification](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_notification)
    
   - [Austoscaling](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/autoscaling_group)
    
   - [Launch-template](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/launch_template)

- Create ***asg-bastion-nginx.tf*** and paste all the code snippet below;

<img width="957" alt="ASG bastion-Nginx" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/0898e1d6-bdd0-4403-8028-8ebe3c74c094">


- **Autoscaling for wordpress and toolibng will be created in a seperate file**

- Create ***asg-wordpress-tooling.tf*** and paste the following code

<img width="960" alt="AGS Wordpress-Tooling" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/11955dc6-cf08-44ca-98d4-caf6e0bbb0f7">


**STORAGE AND DATABASE**

- Useful Terraform Documentation, go through this documentation and understand the arguement needed for each resources:

   - [RDS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/db_subnet_group)
   
   - [EFS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/efs_file_system)

   - [KMS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/kms_key)

- **Create Elastic File System (EFS)**
  
- In order to create an EFS you need to create a [KMS key](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/getting-started/).

- AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications.

- Add the following code for KMS to ***efs.tf***

- Let us create EFS and it mount targets- add the following code to efs.tf

<img width="959" alt="efs" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/fbc3122f-a8e3-48b6-a5ab-6eed78b58d93">


**Create [MySQL RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html)**

- Let us create the RDS itself using this snippet of code in ***rds.tf*** file:

<img width="777" alt="Creating rds" src="https://github.com/eyolegoo/PROJECT-17/assets/115954100/d124078b-79e4-4bdd-b69d-a92b033f8e6e">
